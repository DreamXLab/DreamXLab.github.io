  content: "I actively support former students and postdoctoral researchers in launching deep-tech startups. I am also deeply engaged in commercializing our research by collaborating directly with customers, industry partners, investors, and university technology transfer offices to bring our innovations to market and drive real-world impact."
Engineer_and_Economic_Consultant:
  enabled: true
  content: "While I devote most of my time to advancing AI and robotics, I may occasionally engage in engineering and economics consulting when opportunities align with relevance, interest, and real-world impact. I approach these engagements not only as a contributor but also as a learner, leveraging them to extract use-case intelligence and structural insights that inform both research and innovation. In engineering, I provide expertise in construction, infrastructure, and energy systems, with a particular focus on data center design, delivery, and operations. In economics, I provide expertise in capital project planning, freight and logistics strategy, digital transformation, automation and technology adoption, as well as market and policy intelligence."
Educator:
  enabled: true
  content: "Civil engineering is far more than it is often perceived to be—“digging dirt,” “pouring concrete,” or “counting traffic.” It encompasses every dimension of what, where, and how we inhabit, sustain, and evolve life on Earth and beyond in daily life and under extreme conditions. It is a discipline fundamentally rooted in service to humanity and the advancement of civilization. As an educator, I view teaching not only as the transfer of knowledge, but also as a shared intellectual expedition. I engage with students across disciplines and levels, learning and evolving together as we envision and engineer the future of our natural and built environments. Together, we ground emerging technologies in the realities of how people live, move, connect, and create, transforming grand challenges into pathways for progress and lasting impact."

I am a tenured Associate Professor at the University of Florida and the Director of the DreamX Lab, where I lead research in AI, robotics, and data science. Prior to joining UF, I held the David Goodpasture Endowed faculty position in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Tennessee Knoxville, with a joint appointment in the Department of Mechanical, Aerospace, and Biomedical Engineering. During my time there, I was promoted from Assistant Professor (2017–2023) to Associate Professor with tenure (2023–2025).

I have an interdisciplinary expertise and experience. I earned my Ph.D. degree in Civil Engineering from Purdue University in 2017, where I also received three M.S. degrees in Economics (2016), Industrial Engineering (2015), and Construction Engineering and Management (2014). My undergraduate studies were completed at Tianjin University, China, where I received dual B.S. degrees in Hydraulics and Hydroelectric Engineering and Project Management, both in 2012.

I strive to contribute as an AI Explorer, deep tech Entrepreneur, Engineer and Economic consultant, as well as a dedicated Educator. I am committed to advancing use-inspired innovation and translating research into real-world impact through collaboration, mentorship, and technology-driven solutions.
