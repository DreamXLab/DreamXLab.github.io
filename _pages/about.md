I hold a Ph.D. in Civil Engineering (2017) from Purdue University, where I also earned M.S. degrees in Economics (2016), Industrial Engineering (2015), and Construction Engineering and Management (2014). I received B.S. degrees in Hydraulics & Hydroelectric Engineering (2012) and Project Management (2012) from Tianjin University. Prior to joining the University of Florida, I served at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, where I was promoted from Assistant Professor (2017–2023) to Tenured Associate Professor (2023–2024), with a primary appointment in Civil & Environmental Engineering and a joint appointment in Mechanical, Aerospace & Biomedical Engineering. I am an AI Explorer, deep tech Entrepreneur, Economic consultant and Engineer, and dedicated Educator.
